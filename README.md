SAM - Spatial Analysis from Masks A suite of tools designed to streamline common image analysis tasks in scientific research. This suite currently includes the Mask Accuracy Verifier, File Renamer, and ROI Extractor.

Downloads You can download the latest compiled, ready-to-use versions of all applications for macOS and Windows from the Releases Page.

Tools Included

|----- Preprocessing -----|

Mask Accuracy Verifier: Analyzes masks of predicted signal against raw images to flag potentially inaccurate segmentations based on intensity ratios and coverage.

File Renamer: A powerful batch-renaming tool to clean up filenames by removing specified parts or adding prefixes/suffixes.

ROI Extractor: Extracts embedded ImageJ ROIs from .tif files and saves them as separate .zip files.

|----- Analysis -----|

SAM: Interogates colocalization, spatial organization, and spatial expanse of objects around amyloid-beta plaques.

Stats Tool: Using columns in an Excel file, identifies outliers using ROUT (Q=1%), determines normality, runs the correct statistical tests, calculates effect sizes, and optionally generates graphs.
